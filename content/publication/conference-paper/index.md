abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces two major issues, privacy leakage and poisoning attacks, which may seriously undermine the reliability and security of the system. Overcoming them simultaneously poses a great challenge. This is because pri- vacy protection policies prohibit access to users’ local gradients to avoid privacy leakage, while Byzantine-robust methods necessi- tate access to these gradients to defend against poisoning attacks. To address these problems, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Byzantine-robust FL framework PROFL. PROFL is based on the two-trapdoor additional homomorphic encryption algorithm and blinding techniques to ensure the data privacy of the entire FL process. During the defense process, PROFL first utilize secure Multi-Krum algorithm to remove malicious gradients at the user level. Then, according to the Pauta criterion, we innovatively propose a statistic-based privacy-preserving defense algorithm to eliminate outlier interference at the feature level and resist impersonation poisoning attacks with stronger concealment. De- tailed theoretical analysis proves the security and efficiency of the proposed method. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, and PROFL improved accuracy by 39% to 75% across different attack settings compared to similar privacy-preserving robust methods, demonstrating its significant advantage in robustness.
